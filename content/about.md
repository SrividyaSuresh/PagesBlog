**Hello World!**

Srividya here. I'm a .. reader of books, chocolate hoarder, herbal tea enthusiast, relucatant cook, data nerd, science storyteller, teacher, pet parent, curious artist, travel (over)planner, and.. I'll keep you informed I guess. And in one of these, I've built a career. The rest remain but humble hobbies that I dedicate my life to. 

I've been wanting to do this forever. Start a blog. Put my thoughts out into the world. And maybe hear an echo back. My own thoughts are but an echo of the growing sum of me. The me winding through this world, somehow finding my way to your screen.

So now here you are, reader. Not a friend yet, but maybe a friend already. 
I'll share with you my thoughts, hopefully gaining far more clarity through self-introspection along the way. You don't have to respond (its more work for me to add a comment section anyway), but maybe a smile my way would do us both good. 

See you again!


PS. If you want to contact me anyway, you can reach me at nssvidya [at] gmail [dot] com
